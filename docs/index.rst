|repoinfo|

F5® BIG-IQ® is an **end-to-end visibility**, analytics, configuration, and management solution for **F5 BIG-IP 
application delivery and security services** and the devices that power them. BIG-IQ offers a **unified platform** 
to create, configure, provision, deploy, and manage F5 security and application delivery services. 

This lab is designed to allow for quick and easy demos of a significant portion of the BIG-IQ product’s core 
features and functionality. The environment is setup with basic configuration in place as well as a traffic 
generator that populates the app-centric dashboards. Additional configurations can be added to support workflows 
that are not currently covered in this lab.

This lab environment is available for internal F5 users. Please reach out to your local **F5 Sales representative** 
if you are interested in running one of the labs or to schedule a live demo.
