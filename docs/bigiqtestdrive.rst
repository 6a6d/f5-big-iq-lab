Welcome to the **F5 BIG-IQ Test Drive** - |year|

This lab provides hands-on experience using F5's BIG-IQ.

F5® BIG-IQ™ allows you to take an **application-centric** approach to core IT, networking, development, and 
deployment with a unified tool for managing your F5 application delivery and security portfolio.

BIG-IQ significantly extends the operability and value of your F5 investment with the ability to create, 
configure, deploy, analyze, orchestrate **F5 security and application delivery services**. BIG-IQ supports 
management of **F5 BIG-IP™ physical and virtual** devices both locally and in the cloud.  

From per-app virtual editions to traditional hardware appliances, BIG-IQ makes it possible to **gain visibility** 
into apps and devices, leverage **automated workflows**, simplify configuration, and ensure every team—and every 
app—has the resources required to perform optimally. With BIG-IQ you can **quickly and easily** manage, analyze, 
and **troubleshoot** every device, every application, and every policy from one centralized location—no matter 
the operating environment.
