--------------------------------

Official documentation about AS3 application service management via a GUI can be found on the `BIG-IQ Knowledge Center`_.

.. _`BIG-IQ Knowledge Center`: https://techdocs.f5.com/en-us/bigiq-7-0-0/monitoring-managing-applications-using-big-iq.html

From the lab environment, launch a xRDP/noVNC session to have access to the Ubuntu Desktop. 
To do this, in your lab environment, click on the *Access* button
of the *Ubuntu Lamp Server* system and select *noVNC* or *xRDP*.

.. note:: Modern laptops with higher resolutions you might want to use 1440x900 and once XRDP is launched Zoom to 200%.
