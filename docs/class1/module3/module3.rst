Module 3: BIG-IQ Application Templates & Deployment with AS3 using the UI (7.0 and above)
=========================================================================================

**[New 7.0.0]**

Support of AS3 was delivered in v6.1 which got released December 2018, but only included usage via REST-API. 
With the release of BIG-IQ v7.0, AS3 is now also supported via the use of a GUI. 

NetOps will start driving most of the use case through the GUI via Central Management and having AS3 as a GUI 
feature will drive the expectation that AS3 templates are easier to setup and will give Network and 
Security administrators a kickstart using AS3 as a declarative interface.

See `Module 2`_ for more details on BIG-IQ and AS3 integration.
