Class 1: BIG-IQ Application Management and AS3
==============================================

Overview
^^^^^^^^

In this class, we will review the application management feature available with BIG-IQ 6.0 and above.

Manage app services programmatically with Application Services 3 Extension (AS3) and BIG-IQ:
   - Create, import, and edit AS3 templates to use in deploying application services through a declarative model 
   to managed devices from the BIG-IQ graphical user interface. 
   - Use BIG-IQ with AS3 templates to support standard, declarative app services and security policies 
   for BIG-IP configuration to accelerate app deployment, ensure consistency, and increase app deployment flexibility. 
   - Support infrastructure-as-code with cloud templates and the creation and centralized management of BIG-IP via 
   BIG-IQ in any environment. 
   - Automate and centrally manage advanced application services as part of the F5 Automation Toolchain. 
   - Enhanced visibility of applications deployed over multiple environments 
   - BIG-IQ now supports the creation, visibility, and management of applications deployed across multiple devices, clouds, and data centers. 
   - Allows for enhanced management capabilities of all DNS and HTTP instances of an application deployment, including those configured with AS3. 
   - Enables the system administrator to specify user access and management permissions to the application deployments.
