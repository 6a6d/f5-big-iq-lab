Module 5: Analytics for TCP based Applications (new 7.1)
========================================================

**[New 7.1.0]**

BIG-IQ 7.1 provide TCP analytics, both in the monitoring tab and in the application tab.

These TCP analytics leverage AVR, just as the HTTP analytics do for TMOS 13.1.0.5+.

New AS3 templates are available on https://github.com/f5devcentral/f5-big-iq to support 
AS3 Application Services deployment with TCP analytics.

Legacy Application Service also provide a TCP dashboard which can be used.
