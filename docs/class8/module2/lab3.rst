Resource Group and Role Creation (david)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's first deploy the default Advance WAF policy and Security Logging Profile available in **BIG-IQ** to **SEA-vBIGIP01.termmarc.com**.

1. Login to BIG-IQ as **david**.

2. Go to **Configuration > Security > Web Application Security > Policies**. For this lab, we are going to use WAF policy called ``asm-lab1``. 
   Note this policy is in use by the Application Service **mail_site40htts**.

3. First, we need to create a resource group and include the ``asm-lab1`` policy. 

Navigate under **System > Role Management > Resource Groups** and click to **Create**.

Select in the first drop down menu **Web Application Security Manager** (role type), **Web Application Security (ASM)** (service), 
then **Policies** (object type). Select ``asm-lab1`` policy and add it to the resource group.

Name the resource group ``asm-lab1-rg`` and click on **Save & Close**.

4. Assign the resource group previously created ``asm-lab1-rg`` along with the predefined resource group called ``Resource Group Deployer`` used to allow the user to deploy changes to the policy.

Assign the user **chris**, and name the this custom role ``asm-lab1-role``.

Display all Analytics and Events logs (david)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   to see only security analytics related to its policy assigned through the custom role.
