Module 9: Declarative Onboarding and VE Creation on Azure (new 7.0)
===================================================================

**[New 7.0.0]**

BIG-IQ Centralized Management makes it easy for you to create, configure, and manage BIG-IP VE devices in an Azure environment.

To start managing a BIG-IP VE device in a cloud environment, you'll need to complete the following workflows.
  - Specify your cloud provider details
  - Configure your Azure cloud environment on BIG-IQ
  - Create a BIG-IP VE device
  - Onboard a BIG-IP VE device or BIG-IP VE device cluster

.. Note:: After you save the configuration for the BIG-IP VE devices you created, BIG-IQ sends an API call to apply that configuration to the targeted BIG-IP VE devices. After BIG-IQ successfully applies the configuration, it then discovers and imports the services the device is licensed for. This means you don't have to discover and import services in a separate step.
